# Encrypt-IT

This is a simple command-line tool (for now) that allows file encryption and decryption
using symmetric encryption (Fernet) from the `cryptography` library in Python

- I plan to add a way to connect to a drive server where you can store/retrieve your encrypted files
- I also plan to add asymmetric encryption for key management.

## Why?
- I was bored and got tired of scrolling :0
