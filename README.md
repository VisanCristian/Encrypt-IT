# Encrypt-IT

>> DISCLAIMER: This project was made for fun and learning purposes. Please do not use it for anything illegal :)

This is a simple command-line tool (for now) that allows file encryption and decryption
using symmetric encryption (Fernet) from the `cryptography` library in Python

- I plan to add a way to connect to a drive server where you can store/retrieve your encrypted files
- I also plan to add asymmetric encryption for key management.



## How to run the program
- To make it easier, I have created two scripts that automatically create the environment and install the required packages.
- If you don't want to run the scripts, you can install the packages manually with : `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the program on Linux:
- First, run the `install.sh` file (after giving it execution permissions with `chmod +x install.sh`)
- After that, simply run `main.py` with your python interpreter.

### Running the program on MacOS:
- For now, you can do it using zsh, exactly how you would do it on a Linux machine.

### Running the program on Windows:
- First, run the `install.bat` file using `call install.bat`
- After that, simply run `main.py` with your python interpreter.
